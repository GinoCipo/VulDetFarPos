# Source-Code-Vulnerability-Detection (Python)
Comparing Machine Learning Algorithms for Python Source Code Vulnerability Detection

For training the model run Train-Model.py (mode can be changed for different vulnerabilities)

Pretrained BiLSTM models are present on Model-BiLSTM

Pretrained other Models are present on Model-others

Pretrained word2vec models are present on word2vec_models

For trying the models run the result files with specific vulnerability, e.g., xss-results.ipynb

For demo run the demo file

For training your own word2vec model follow the instructions here https://github.com/LauraWartschinski/VulnerabilityDetection
